David: (looks up from his book, noticing Sarah) Everything alright there?

Sarah: (smiles weakly) Oh, um, yeah. Just a bit on edge. I have a job interview today and I'm trying to calm my nerves.

David: Ah, the pre-interview jitters. What’s the job, if you don’t mind me asking?

Sarah: It's a digital marketing position at a tech startup. It's actually my dream job, so I'm a bit more nervous than usual.

David: Sounds exciting! Have you done many of these interviews before?

Sarah: A few, but none for a company I cared about this much. Every time I think about the interview, I feel like I can’t breathe.

David: I understand. But remember, they called you in because they see potential in you. Just breathe and be yourself.

Sarah: That's kind of you to say. It’s just so hard to feel confident.

David: May I suggest something? Why not pretend you’re having a chat in a coffee shop with a friend, just like this, instead of going into a high stakes interview? It might help you relax.

Sarah: (laughs) I'll try to imagine the interview panel in their pajamas then. Thanks, I needed that lighter perspective.

David: Exactly, there you go! You'll do great. Just show them who Sarah really is. Any preparation questions I can help with? I've read a book or two about interviews.

Sarah: Actually, yes. How should I explain my previous job experience in a way that appeals to a tech company?

David: Highlight how your skills can transition. For instance, talk about your adaptability, how you've embraced technology in previous roles, or led digital projects. Make your past experiences relevant to the future roles you want.

Sarah: That makes a lot of sense. I’ll definitely do that. Thank you, David, I feel a bit better about this.

David: (smiling) You're going to be just fine. Just remember, coffee shop chat. Good luck! 

Sarah: Thanks! I guess it's a good thing I ran into a kind conversationalist like you today.

David: Anytime! Call it fate or good fortune, but I’m glad I could help.
